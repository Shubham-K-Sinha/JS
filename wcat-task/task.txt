 build wcat command

 It is used to display or make a copy content of one or more files in the terminal


 General Syntax : 
 node wcat.js [options] [filepaths]
 option to remove big line break (-s)
 option to add line number to non empty lines (-b)
 option to add line numbers to all lines(-n)


 commands : 

 1---  node wcat.js filepath --> displays content of the file in the terminal
 2---  node wcat.js filepath1 filepath2 filepath3  ---> displays content of all the files in the terminal in (concatinated form) in the terminal
 3---  node wcat.js -s filepath1 filepath2 filepath3.... ---> converts big line breaks into single line breaks
 4---  node wcat.js -n filepath ----> gives numbering to all lines 
 5---  node wcat.js -b filepath ----> gives numbers to all non-empty lines. 


 ____WE CAN MIX AND MATCH WITH MULTIPLE OPTIONS AT ONCE____


 Edge Cases: 
    1---- If file entered is not found then it gives file doesnt exist error.
    2---- -n and -b options which are mutually exclusive so if user types both the options together, then only first option is considered.
